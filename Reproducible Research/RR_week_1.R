# Steps in a data analysis
# Define the question
# You don't have all the facts and have too much info
# The more effort to come up with a specific question
# narrowing your question -> subset data set, simplyfing the problem

# Science -> Data -> Applied Statistics (Programming) -> ((Theoretical Statistics))

# Define the ideal data set
# - Descriptive - a whole population
# - Exploratory - a random sample with many variables measured
# - Inferential - the right pop, randomly sampled
# - Predictive - a training and test data set from the same pop
# - Causal - data from a randomized study
# - Mechanistic - data about all components of th system


## Example - SPAM

# all the data from google gmail data set??

# in Real World you must not have access to all data set
# Sometimes you have to go for something that will no be the ideal data set
# Getting all the data from Google will not be possible
# 1 possible solution - Spambase Data Set - UCI Mach. Learning Repo

## Obtain the data
# - ref the source
# - from internet source, record the url and time accessed (Availability of the data)

## Our data set = SPAM dataset from kernlab package

## Clean the data set
# - raw data often needs to be processed
# - if it is pre-processed, make sure to understand how
# - understand the source of the data
# - may need reformating, subsampling - record the steps
# - Determine if the data is good Enough - if not good enough quit or change data
